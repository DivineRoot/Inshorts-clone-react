## ⚠️ Important Note ⚠️
For some reason, News API only works on mozilla browsers in free plan other than that -
News api doesn't allow you to fetch the api from a deployed site. You can fork this repo and run in your local server and add your apikey in config.js file in the root.

## Demo
Make sure you're using Firefox or running it locally
Here is a working live demo :
